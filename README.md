## Selected Projects

### Qasr Al Hosn Festival, Obscura, 2016

Immersive media tour and an interactive fountain at the 4th Annual Qasr Al Hosn Festival, celebrating the history and culture of the United Arab Emirates.

The tour and interactive fountain consists of two related but separate projects, both built as a part of the festival experience. Over 15 servers and 40 projectors were used in total. The immersive media tour was projected on multiple parts of the historic Qasr Al-Hosn fort, and tells the story of Abu Dhabi and the Emirati people. The interactive fountain is a projection on the ground around a fountain, which reacts to the movement of visitors.

### Oceanic Scales, UC Santa Cruz, 2014

Interactive installation visualizing the balance of the ocean’s ecosystem.

Oceanic Scales is an installation that allows visitors to contextualize sensor data gathered from the MBARI research center, located at the Monterey Bay off the coast of California. It also engages the public in a game that allows users to explore the simplified effects of temperature, pH, and nitrogen levels on the ecosystem of the ocean - and highlights the delicacy of the ocean's ecosystem. The project was developed by Gene A. Felice II and Jenifer Parker with OpenLab at UC Santa Cruz, and has been featured at the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Celebration in Santa Cruz and Soundwave Festival in San Francisco.

### Slugs vs. Bugs, UC Santa Cruz, 2013

Final project for a mechatronics course at UC Santa Cruz. In this course, we worked in a team of four to build an autonomous robot that is capable of navigating across a field marked with black tape while avoiding obstacles and shooting the enemy bot, with the end goal of reaching the enemy gate before the opposing bot does.
